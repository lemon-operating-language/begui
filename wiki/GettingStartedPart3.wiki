<h2>Part 3: Creating a child window</h2>
<p>Creating a new child window inside the frame window can be pretty simple. For a generic window, you could just write:</p>
{{{
	Window wnd;
	...
	wnd.create(left, top, width, height, "title");
	FrameWindow::inst()->addComponent(&wnd);
}}}

<p>(Of course, make sure that the window object is not going to be destroyed, as might not be so obvious in the example above, after the call to `addComponent()`)</p>

<p>However, in most cases we might want to have a derived class for a window in our application. In that case, just derive the base `begui::Window` class, and override methods (like `initialize()`) to change the window behavior. Let's see an example:</p>

{{{
	// header file:
	class MyWindow : public Window
	{
	private:
		// components:
		Button m_btn;
		...
	public:
		...
		virtual void onCreate();
		...
	};
	...
	// cpp file:
	...
	void MyWindow::onCreate()
	{
		// create the button here
		m_btn.create(10, 10, "OK");

		// add this button as a child of the window. This is
		// necessary for the button to be displayed and function.
		addComponent(&m_btn);
	}
        ...
}}}

<p>We would use the derived class just like the base `Window` class in the first example. For a more complete example, see the `guitest` project in the beGUI source package.</p>
